        <p>DC Comics, formerly known as Detective Comics Inc., is an American publishing house specializing in the publication of comics, a publishing division of DC Entertainment, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Global Brands and Franchises and in turn of Warner Bros. Discovery. Known on the international scene as one of the most eminent exponents of the comics industry, during her existence she has printed iconic characters of the superhero genre, such as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman; it has also distinguished itself for the creation of characters and franchises external to mainstream fiction but critically acclaimed, such as the Watchmen saga, the Sandman Universe and the Vertigo brand. Various trans-media works are also directly related to DC Comics, from films to video games, through television series: among the most ambitious projects from this point of view are the Arrowverse and the DC Extended Universe. <br> Chaired since 2018 by Pamela Lifford, it has been based in Burbank, California since 2015.</p>
